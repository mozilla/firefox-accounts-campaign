# Making Changes

To make changes, change the files in this repository. You can do this through the GitHub edit function if desired (and as long as you have write access to this repo). The master branch is configured for GitHub Pages and therefore changes will show up directly (or with a few minutes delay sometimes) on https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-accounts-campaign
